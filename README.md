# GenSet
**GenSet** is a C++ project that implements a simple Set data structure using templates. It supports basic set operations like:

- Adding unique elements
- Accessing elements by index
- Set union
- Set intersection
- Deep copying of sets

This project demonstrates the power of **C++ templates** and basic **OOP principles** without using STL or external libraries.

## Features
- Generic (works with any data type)
- Constructor, Copy Constructor, and Destructor
- Union and Intersection operations
- Clean console display of sets

## How to Run
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o run
./run
